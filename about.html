		<p>Here at Buds and Branches we love all things well designed. Our main branch specializes in print media, specifically trypography based projects. However we have budding projects that pop up occasionally for a limited time. These may be the special offerings of guest designers. Handmade objects limited by supply or items you can personalize or you try being a designer. Work with us to create the perfect piece, cards, photoset to take home and you get to put your own stamp on it too!</p>
